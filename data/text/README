quran-data.xml originally from http://tanzil.net/wiki/Quran_Metadata but modified
by me to fix the beginning of some parts.

The original license allows doing whatever with that file.

quran-uthmani.xml: Downloaded from tanzil.net
quran-simple-enhanced.xml: Downloaded from tanzil.net

Downloading from tanzil.net
   - Go to http://tanzil.net/download/
   - Select Uthmani, check everything and XML as the format. Save as quran-uthmani.xml
   - Select Simple Enhanced, check everything and XML as the format. Save as quran-simple-enhanced.xml

Building:
  qmake && make
  That should generate ../metadata.h
